# Multi-Timer-App
--App to use multiple concurrent labeled timers--

I'm someone who is always cooking elaborate, multi-step meals, and I also always wait to do my laundry until it's a giant pile that towers over the horizon. So whether I'm making dishes that use multiple stove burners and oven racks, or I'm just washing something in the washer while something else is in the dryer, I find myself needing multiple timers at once. So I'm making an iOS app to allow myself to use multiple concurrent timers that I can label as I see necessary. I don't expect that this is a particularly revolutionary idea, I just came up with it and decided I'd use it to create my first iOS app. This app is a creative exercise in building my swift/app development/design skills, so I'll see where it takes me.
